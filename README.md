# EVCharge
Data and programs related to computing EV charging time


There are CSV files containing raw data, like for plotting comparison graphs between vehicles or variants of the same vehicle, and for easily adding new data.

A Json file contains the same data (manually synchronised right now), to be usable by a program.

A php script "chargetime.php" allows to request time from a low % level, to a high % level, for a specified model and according to a max power available on the charging station.
